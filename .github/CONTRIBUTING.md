# Contributing to Pithre Weather

Hi! Thank you for your interest in contributing to Pithre Weather, we really appreciate it.

There are many ways to contribute – reporting bugs, feature suggestions, fixing bugs, submitting pull requests for enhancements.

## Reporting Bugs, Asking Questions, Sending Suggestions

Just [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/bravokeyl/nmonit/issues), that’s all. If you want to prefix the title with a “Question:”, “Bug:”, or the general area of the application, that would be helpful, but by no means mandatory. If you have write access, add the appropriate labels.

Feel free to share your unique context to help us understand your perspective. You can add context tags such as: `#journey` `#anecdote` `#narrative` `#context` `#empathy` `#perspective` `#reallife` `#dogfooding` `#livesharing` `#flowsharing` `#anxiety` `#anxiety-flow` `#stresscase` `#painpoint`. We'd also love to know how you found the bug: `#dogfooding`, `#manual-testing`, `#automated-testing`, or `#user-report` if applicable.
